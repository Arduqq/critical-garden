    title: "üê¢ I don't care about the Pretty Picture"
---
As an artist, AI art has been on my mind constantly, and my strongly negative opinion on it comes from the ignorance in data crawling and non-defining art as a concept. Creating helps me transform my thoughts into flesh (or digital flesh in the case of this garden). Every piece of art is a snapshot of experiences to me. When you create something beautiful, you create a piece that reflects your sweat and blood from practicing your skill. When you create something fun, it's because you and others love to laugh. In any way, art requires experiences. It's the lifeblood of any piece of art to me.

Now anything pretty becomes with the clumsiest of text prompts, yet the value of it remains obscure to me. Never do AI images invoke meaningful emotion. Never do they make you wonder. They are pretty, they are glitchy and their value comes from seeming realistic and obscure. Reality, however, we can barely grasp if we stop [[acknowledging-models|thinking about what lies beneath]].

We have shifted our definition of art towards the result, but anything else just won't fit in our schedule. The time we need to communicate the mechanisms influencing our minds seems endless, so I wonder where and when we can begin. We are busy, but our cereal looks AI-pretty at least.
