## Reflection
Information, truth, and reality - all these terms feel vague and difficult to comprehend when we try to see the bigger picture of a Simulacrum. I was rather surprised when we started connecting it to Virtual Reality since to me it always felt like yet another medium. Like it's something Baudrillard would consider yet another Simulacrum just like any old newspaper, show, or recording. It is highly dependant on its context - who, why, and with what they made it. It's an amalgamation of socio-technical modules with their own underlying models. I wonder about strategies to [[acknowledging-models|detect such models]] easier. Digging deeper, VR sets the tone for something I want to explore further to understand how context is essential when observing research practice. My view on VR is tainted by the practices of research departments at my old university, and it fuels my interest in deconstructing implementations and their purpose. It opens the wider question of why we should research further and when it's time to stop.

While Deep Fakes and their social implications felt obviously dangerous to me, seeing it from further, more explicit perspectives was fascinating. Realizing that "[[nice-things|we can't have nice things]]" during our observation of sex work and AI, it was clear to me that the possibilities of emerging, unjust power dynamics are daunting. It makes me worry about the people who are not able to understand these dangers. It makes me worry about how I as a researcher might contribute to a greater good.

I personally have a strong distaste for AI technology in its current form and [[pretty-picture|struggle to follow its appeal]]. I believe to approach it critically does not mean to condemn and invalidate it. A conscious effort towards acknowledging its potential is crucial, yet I feel like I still lack the proficiency to situate myself within the discourse.
